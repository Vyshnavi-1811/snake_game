# snake_game 
The most popular snake game now in Web.

We've made this game using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT. 

Included the HTML,CSS,JS parts of the game in a single .html file using < body > for html,< style > for css and < script > for the javascript part of the code. Recreated the common game by adding the following extras #1.grid lines,#2.multiple colors to the food block,#3.sparks when the snake eats food,#4.never ending and continous boundaries for the grid and made it as a fun modified snake game.

## Game Mechanics

At start the snake lies at the center facing right with size 1 unit and the position of food can be random,
you need press any arrow key to start with and move towards the food when the snake eats food size of snake increaes by one unit and the food disappers 

a new position of food will be allocated in the grid and now you must aim to eats the food in new position and increase the size of snake

when the head of the snake touches its own body,the game ends and your score will be dispalyed.
